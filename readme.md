We're learning Scratch today for the purpose of building interactive learning experiences.

[Scratch](http://scratch.mit.edu) is a fantastic, free, open-source project out of the Lifelong 
Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab.

We will use it to read keyboard input and drive media on the computer based on that.

I've put together a little [Scratch Studio](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/4630706/) that 
contains just one sketch that I started working on; we'll add to that Studio today.

If you are interested, I'm also happy to cover a few alternative creative coding environments 
(specifically, p5js and Processing) to show more how this sort of thing works in a more 
traditional text-based software environment.

## Our plan

* introductions
* this space up for grabs! What would you like to cover? How can this time best suit your 
classroom 
needs?
