# Propel

We're learning Scratch today for the purpose of building interactive learning experiences.

[Scratch](http://scratch.mit.edu) is a fantastic, free, open-source project out of the Lifelong 
Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab.

We will use it to read keyboard input and drive media on the computer based on that.

I've put together a little [Scratch Studio](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/4630706/) that 
contains just one sketch that I started working on; we'll add to that Studio today.
